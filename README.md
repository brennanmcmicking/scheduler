# scheduler

> Scheduler? I hardly know 'er! - Brennan

Scheduler is the re-implementation of [CourseUp](https://github.com/VikeLabs/courseup),
but in âœ¨Rustâœ¨ ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ which mean's it's blazinglyðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ fastðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

# Getting Started

1. Either you received dev AWS creds from Brennan or you'll need to run DynamoDB locally:
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local
```

then make sure `USE_LOCAL_DYNAMO` is set on your env

2. Install `cargo-watch`:
```
cargo install cargo-watch
```
3. Scrape some section data
```
cargo run --bin scraper -- --oldest 202401
```
(feel free to adjust the oldest section date)

4. Run the scheduler
```
cargo watch -x run
```
with `DISCORD_SECRET` if you want to test out logging in with Discord:
```
DISCORD_SECRET=... cargo watch -x run
```
